# Project Title

My Photo Web App

## Instructions for Build and Use

[Software Demo](https://youtu.be/PPKdWa-i-uw)

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. In order to run the software check if you have Python installed by running "python --version"
2. If you have Python installed then run "python -m pip install Django"
3. Run "git clone https://github.com/pavelwebdeveloper/photo_website.git" locally on your computer in CMD
4. Start server by running "python manage.py runserver"
5. In your browser in the address bar type "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"

Instructions for using the software:

1. It has a header with menu links to navigate to photo gallery page and contact form page
2. You can search for photos through a search input field 
3. You can submit a message on the Contact page through a contact form. It will output error messages if you
enter the information incorrectly and inform you what is wrong with the information. Then you can submit it. The messages will be saved in the local SQlite database.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] To host the app on a web server
* [ ] To add to the display of details for a photo
* [ ] To be able to download a photo
* [ ] To be able to get messages to my email in addition to saving them in a database
* [ ] To add the ability to log into my admin account and manage the app from there (for example to upload more photos, to edit information about them, to delete them)
